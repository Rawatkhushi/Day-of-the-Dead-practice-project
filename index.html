            Day of the Dead (Dia De Los Muertos) is a two day holiday that
            reunites the living and dead. Families create ofrendas (Offerings)
            to honor their departed family members that have passed. These
            altars are decorated with bright yellow marigold flowers, photos of
            the departed, and the favorite foods and drinks of the one being
            honored. The offerings are believed to encourage visits from the
            land of the dead as the departed souls hear their prayers, smell
            their foods and join in the celebrations!
          </p>
          <p class="dedication-to-the-deceased-p3">
            Day of the Dead is a rare holiday for celebrating death and life. It
            is unlike any holiday where mourning is exchanged for celebration.

            Dia de los Angelitos (Day of the little angels) starts the holiday
            at midnight on Nov 1st, where the spirits of all deceased children
            are believed to be reunited with their families for 24 hours.
            Families construct an altar, known as an ofrenda, with the departed
            child's favorite snacks, candies, toys, and photographs to encourage
            a visit from their departed children. The names of the departed
            children will often be written on a sugar skull.

            At midnight of the following day (November 2nd), the celebrations
            shift to honor the lives of the departed adults. The night is filled
            with laughter and fun memories, much like the night before. However,
            the Ofrendas take on a more adult-like theme with tequila, pan de
            muerto, mezcal, pulque and jars of Atole. Families will also play
            games together, reminisce about their loved ones, and dance while
            the village band plays in their town.

            The next day is the grand finale and public celebration of Dia de
            Muertos. In more recent times, people come together in their cities,
            dressed up with Calavera painted faces (Skeletons) and have parades
            in the streets. Cemetery visits are also common on the last day as
            families will go to decorate the grave sites with Marigold flowers,
            gifts, and sugar skulls with the departed’s name on them. It’s
            customary to clean the grave stone and restore the color.
