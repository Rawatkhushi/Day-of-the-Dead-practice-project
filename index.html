            Day of the Dead (Dia De Los Muertos) is a two day holiday that
            reunites the living and dead. Families create ofrendas (Offerings)
            to honor their departed family members that have passed. These
            altars are decorated with bright yellow marigold flowers, photos of
            the departed, and the favorite foods and drinks of the one being
            honored. The offerings are believed to encourage visits from the
            land of the dead as the departed souls hear their prayers, smell
            their foods and join in the celebrations!
          </p>
          <p class="dedication-to-the-deceased-p3">
            Day of the Dead is a rare holiday for celebrating death and life. It
            is unlike any holiday where mourning is exchanged for celebration.
